Most people simply call him "Sly". 

He's an independent web consultant, cybersecurity enthusiast, and self-proclaimed lifehacker. When he's not talking about himself in 3rd person, he's usually making websites for clients or consulting with them about how they can improve what they have.

Anyway, back to 1st person. 

Here are some of the things I do:

* Develop sales funnels (or optimizing what already exists to improve conversions)
* Create evergreen email marketing campaigns
* Plan and execute product launches
* Make systems and processes to streamline operations
* Or simply provide direction with big picture ideas

As a freelance consultant, I've had the privilege of working with many entrepeneurs and taking part in many exciting projects. If you're interested in working together, you can learn more about my services and view some of my work [here](https://aestheticpixels.io/).

## The Non-Work Stuff

I'm a minimalist. I love anything that has a clean, aesthetically-pleasing design.

I have a thing for simplifying complexity. Because why make things harder than they need to be?

In 2015, I gave away everything I owned, [put my whole life in one bag](/blog/crazy), and traveled the world for a few years. I was practically a nomad until 2019. 

I try to [write](/blog) every now and then. If you're curious to know what tools and tech I use on a regular basis, check out my [Things](/things) page for a list of my favorite products & services.
