title: "About Slyvon Blanco"

Most people just call him "Sly". He's an independent web developer, designer, consultant, and chicken wings addict. When he's not talking about himself in 3rd person, he's usually designing websites for clients or consulting with them about how they can improve what they have

Anyway, back to 1st person. 

Here are some of the things I do:

* Develop sales funnels (or optimizing what already exists to improve conversions)
* Create evergreen email marketing campaigns
* Plan and execute product launches
* Make systems and processes to streamline operations
* Or simply provide direction with big picture ideas

As a freelance consultant, I've had the privilege of working with other entrepeneurs and taking part in many exciting projects. If you're interested in working together, you can learn more about my services and view some of my work [here](https://aestheticpixels.io/).

## The Casual Stuff

I'm a minimalist. I love anything that has a clean, aesthetically-pleasing design.

I have a thing for simplifying complexity. Because why make things harder than they need to be?

Home base is in Illinois. But in 2015, I gave away everything I owned and traveled the world. My whole life was in one bag, and I lived out of AirBnbs. *(Fall 2019 update: I'm currently living in the San Diego area.)*

I also try to [write](/blog) every now and then. If you're curious to know how I work, check out my [Things](/things) page for a list of my favorite products & services.
