title: "Things I Use"
---

import InfoBox from '@components/InfoBox.astro'


People always ask me what tools I use (I guess it's because I'm the kind of guy who does research on everything). So I made this page. It's a list of some of the things I use that help make my life a little better.

<InfoBox>DISCLOSURE: I have referral/affiliate links for some of the stuff listed on this page. It won't cost you extra, though, and I only list things I actually use myself. If you decide to support me by using my links to try out a product or service — thank you.</InfoBox>

## For Your Devices

**[Brave](https://brave.com) (Web Browser)**  
Privacy and security are built right in, so there's no need to install extra extensions like ad and script blockers. One of my favorite things about it: being able to watch YouTube videos WITHOUT getting interrupted by annoying ads.

**[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) (Password Manager)**  
Free, open-source, and highly-secure password manager. I've tried other password managers like LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, etc. While all those other ones might look fancier, nothing beats Bitwarden's functionality and ease of use.

**[Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en) (VPN)**  
I've tried a bunch of VPN services (both free and paid) throughout the years, but I always come back to Mullvad. Most providers slow down your internet speed and can't access streaming sites like Netflix. Mullvad is fast, cheap (only ~$5/mo), and cares about your privacy. They don't ask for any of your personal information whatsoever when creating an account.

**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) (Cloud Encryption)**  
If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud Drive, use Cryptomator (free and open-source) to encrypt some of your important files before uploading them to the cloud. That way, those cloud companies — or anyone that gets access to those files — can't snoop into your confidential stuff.

**[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (Mac Productivity App)**  
I can't live without this app. It's what I use to make keyboard macros, shortcuts, text expansions, and other time-saving commands.

## For Business

**[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com)** or **[Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) (Domain Names)**  
I've minimized my use and reliance of Google's services, but the one thing I'll continue to use is their domain registration service. It's the simplest checkout process I've seen, and their user interface is very clean. Namecheap is another great alternative. Both give you WHOIS privacy free of charge. Stay away from GoDaddy.

**[Convertkit](https://go.slyvon.com/convertkit)  (Email Marketing)**  
Advanced enough to do many things, but simple and easy to use compared to other alternatives. I've used other email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, etc. I've never looked back since I started using Convertkit.

**[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (Self-hosted Websites)**  
For creating any type of website. Very versatile, extremely user-friendly, and highly customizable.

**[Flywheel](https://go.slyvon.com/flywheel)  (WordPress Hosting)**  
I've used quite a few web hosting providers, and it's always the cheap ones that gave me issues (I'm looking at you Hostgator and Bluehost). Flywheel costs a bit more than most providers, but what you get in return is quality. Oh, and fast websites. Like, really fast.

**[WP Rocket](https://go.slyvon.com/wprocket)  (WordPress Caching and Speed Plugin)**  
An amazing all-in-one plugin for speeding up and improving the performance of your WordPress sites. I've tried other alternatives that were free to use, but none of them had the simplicity and ease-of-use of WP Rocket.

**[WP Forms](https://go.slyvon.com/wpforms)  (WordPress Form Builder)**  
My go-to form plugin that I use for my WordPress sites, as well as my clients'. The paid version of WP Forms allows you to create payment pages that (securely) accept credit card info, which was a big plus in my eyes.
