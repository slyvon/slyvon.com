title: "Things I Use"
---

import InfoBox from '@components/InfoBox.astro'


People always ask me what tools I use (I guess it's because I'm the kind of guy who does research on everything). So I made this page. It's a list of some of the things I use that help make my life a little better.

<InfoBox>DISCLOSURE: I have referral/affiliate links for some of the stuff listed on this page. It won't cost you extra, though, and I only list things I actually use myself. If you decide to support me by using my links to try out a product or service â€” thank you.</InfoBox>

## For Your Devices

**[Brave](https://brave.com) (Web Browser)**  
Privacy and security are built right in, so there's no need to install extra extensions like ad and script blockers. One of my favorite things about it: being able to watch YouTube videos WITHOUT getting interrupted by annoying ads.

**[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) (Password Manager)**  
Free, open-source, and minimal password manager. Premium version is only $10/year. If you don't like the overly-simplistic nature of Bitwarden, 1Password is the next best alternative which I used for many years before making the switch.

**[ExpressVPN](https://go.slyvon.com/expressvpn) (VPN)**  
I've tried a bunch of VPN services (both free and paid), and ExpressVPN comes out on top. Most providers slow down your internet speed and can't access streaming sites like Netflix. ExpressVPN is fast, covers all the bases when it comes to privacy & security, and can access streaming sites (if you use the right server).

**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org) (Cloud Encryption)**  
If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud Drive, use Cryptomator (free and open-source) to encrypt some of your important files before uploading them to the cloud. That way, those cloud companies can't snoop into your confidential stuff.

**[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (Mac Productivity App)**  
I can't live without this app. It's what I use to make keyboard macros, shortcuts, text expansions, and other time-saving commands.

## For Business

**[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com)** or **[Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) (Domain Names)**  
I've minimized my use and reliance of Google's services, but the one thing I'll continue to use is their domain registration service. It's the simplest checkout process I've seen, and their user interface is very clean. Namecheap is another great alternative. Both give you WHOIS privacy free of charge. Stay away from GoDaddy.

**[Convertkit](https://go.slyvon.com/convertkit)  (Email Marketing)**  
Advanced enough to do many things, but simple and easy to use compared to other alternatives. I've used other email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, etc. I've never looked back since I started using Convertkit.

**[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (Making Websites)**  
For creating any type of website. Very versatile, extremely user-friendly, and highly customizable.

**[Flywheel](https://go.slyvon.com/flywheel)  (WordPress Hosting)**  
I've used quite a few web hosting providers, and it's always the cheap ones that gave me issues (I'm looking at you Hostgator and Bluehost). Flywheel costs a bit more than most providers, but what you get in return is quality. Oh, and fast websites. Like, really fast.

**[WP Rocket](https://go.slyvon.com/wprocket)  (WordPress Caching and Speed Plugin)**  
An amazing all-in-one plugin for speeding up and improving the performance of your WordPress sites. I've tried other alternatives that were free to use, but none of them had the simplicity and ease-of-use of WP Rocket.

**[WP Forms](https://go.slyvon.com/wpforms)  (WordPress Form Builder)**  
My go-to form plugin that I use for my WordPress sites, as well as my clients'. The paid version of WP Forms allows you to create payment pages that (securely) accept credit card info, which was a big plus in my eyes.
