When I was 15, every kid I knew in school had an Xbox.

I wanted one, but I hated asking my parents for things (I still do and always will).

So I got myself a job working at a movie theater.

When I was 16, I wanted my own car.

So I started my first business, sold it a couple years later, and bought my first car.

When I was 18, I got sick of being bullied (it's very easy to pick on the short kid who's barely 100lbs).

So I hit the weights, put on 50+lbs of muscle, and for the first time in my life, had the confidence to stand up for myself.

When I was 20, I told myself that I'd make a full-time living helping other people with their fitness by the time I hit 25.

So I started training people in the gym, and typed away on my keyboard.

This week I turned 25 accomplishing what I set out to do 5 years ago.

As I celebrated my birthday by going on a hike at one of the beautiful canyons in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, I was able to reflect on some things that I believe contributed to the milestones I've reached up to this point in my life.

I'd like to share four of them with you in case you get something out of them.

I don't have life figured out, but I think the following things are key to creating the life you want.

## 1\. To Achieve Anything, You Need Extreme FOCUS

Last year, I took the biggest risk of my life.

I made the decision to book a one-way ticket out of the country, put my life in a backpack, and get out of my comfort zone.

It was something I knew I had to do to take VonBlancoFitness to the next level and help more people.

I didn't want to be comfortable.

I didn't want any distractions.

I didn't want to have a plan B.

It's only been a few months, but the risk I took has already started to pay off.

Now that I can put my focus on my writing and my clients, I'm able to put a positive dent on the universe.

This isn't to say that you should do the same thing (i.e. live a minimalist lifestyle or go all-in on something).

BUT if there's something you want to achieve, **you need to have your sight set on it.**

Do whatever it takes to get there, and don't let anything hold you back.

## 2\. Always Know Your "Why"

I got into fitness because I didn't want to be bullied anymore.

That was the underlying reason why I was very consistent with my diet and training.

Sure, having muscles is awesome. But all I really wanted was to have the confidence to stand up for myself.

That was it.

If you find yourself questioning your success at any time, think about the reason why you started in the first place.

Because is it really just about losing 10, 20, or 30 pounds?

Is it really just about dropping your pants size?

Is it really just about putting on more muscle so you look better naked?

Or is there something more to it…

Once you figure out your "why", all that's left between you and your goals is time.

## 3\. Say "No" to (Almost) Everything

This sorta goes back to the point I made above.

You see, society tells us to say "yes" to everything.

I agree… to an extent.

You should say "yes" to opportunities that come your way because you never know what they can lead to.

**But saying "no" can be even more powerful.**

Why? Because by saying no to the things that don't take you closer to your goals, you can focus on the things that do.

In the last couple years, I've had many opportunities come my way that would have helped me make more money had I said yes to them.

The thing is, those opportunities didn't align with my goals; my philosophies when it comes to fitness; or my values as a person.

A supplement company, for example, wanted to partner up with VBF. All I had to do was sell you their crap on my site and on social media. Whether you bought or not, I was going to get paid.

Unfortunately for them, that's not how I roll.

So I said no.

Even though our situations are different, you can still find ways to say no in everyday life.

If you're trying to improve your diet but face many challenges that's trying to sabotage it, the good news is that you're in control of your actions.

You don't have to eat the doughnuts your co-worker brought in to the office.

You don't have to skip your workout just for happy hour.

You don't have to eat the same calorie-dense meal that your friends are eating at the restaurant.

Remember, the choice is always yours to make.

## 4\. Invest In Things and/or People That Will Help You Get More Done In Less Time

I'm the type of person that always tries to do everything by myself.

It's helped me develop a lot of skills, but it's also caused me to waste a lot of precious time that I could have spent on more important things.

So last year, I decided to change things up.

Instead of figuring things out on my own like I usually do, I…

* Went to some fitness and business events to learn from the best.
* Started to delegate some of my graphic design work so I can focus on creating content that actually provides value.
* Bought books and online courses on certain topics instead of wasting my time Googleing for answers.
* Invested in software that helped improve my clients' coaching experience. (I used to send training & diet programs through Word docs and Excel spreadsheets. Ew. Now we use an app that's more convenient AND fun).

Although all these things cost me a lot of money upfront, the return on investment has been priceless.

Here's how _you_ can apply this to your own life…

Think about the one or two things that you're currently spending a lot of time and energy on. Now think about the one thing/person that you can invest in that would help make your life easier.

In fitness, that could mean hiring a coach that would help speed up the process of getting in amazing shape.

In business, it could mean hiring an assistant.

Whatever it is you're sick of spending a lot of time and energy on, find a way to delegate so you can spend more time on the things that actually matter in life: your family, your hobbies, etc.

## 5\. Start With Imperfect Action

Don't wait for perfect.

There's no such thing as a "perfect time"… a "perfect workout"… a "perfect diet"… a "perfect trainer"… a "perfect fitness app", etc.

**Because even in the best case scenario, nothing will ever be perfect.**

That's a fact.

Don't wait for things to be perfect.

Don't wait to have more information.

Don't wait to have enough money or time before you take action…

… because if you do, you're doomed for mediocrity.

Take the first step, and make your way from there.
